  # Inspiration and Safety

  Conferences are not only about listening. Most of the value comes from talking to each other. Our mission is to create an inspiring, thoughtful, creative and safe space to everyone involved. The venue is known to be of good quality - it’s a University of Wroclaw building. It has many ways to ensure safety of all the people inside like monitoring and special security people.

  It is needless to say that this conference is a place for good people, only. Good people respect each other, are nice to each other, smile, and make everyone (without exceptions) feel comfortable.

  **Need Help?** As part of our goal, we’re dedicated to react to all situations that we’ll be notified, ideally directly to us. There will be a special **phone number**, you can call at any time to let us know about any problem or ask any question.

  You have our contact details in the emails we've sent.

  There will be a special phone number, you can call at any time to let us know about any problem or ask any question. Additionally, there will be a special team of **student volunteers** who will be visible during the conference (If you want to join the team, please let us know). Student volunteers are here to help find your way around and resolve any problem.
