              Steve is a teacher, aspiring digital humanities scholar and open source developer. He maintains the <a href="http://hackety-hack.com/">Hackety Hack</a> project, which allows anyone to learn software development via Ruby. He was a Ruby Hero in 2011 and is involved with many Ruby-based open source projects. He's currently writing a book about APIs titled <a href="http://getsomere.st/">Get some REST</a>.
              <h4><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PB_pO_jU38" target="_blank">Designing Hypermedia APIs</a></h4>
              <p>Rails did a lot to bring REST to developers, but its conception leaves the REST devotee feeling a bit empty. "Where's the hypermedia?" she says. "REST isn't RPC," he may cry. "WTF??!?!" you may think. "I have it right there! resources :posts ! What more is there? RPC? Huh?"</p>
               <p>In this talk, Steve will explain how to design your APIs so that they truly embrace the web and HTTP. Just as there's an impedance mismatch between our databases, our ORMs, and our models, there's an equal mismatch between our applications, our APIs, and our clients. Pros and cons of this approach will be discussed, as well as why we aren't building things this way yet.</p>

              <p>Most Ruby developers use Rails for their everyday projects. Often they toy around with front-end themselves or outsource it, ending up tangled in a web of css-all-over-the-place.</p>

              <p>‘When I open up a Rails project and the models dir is full of 100% ActiveRecord classes I shudder. Model ≠ Persistence.’ — Ben Mabey</p>
              <p>From DCI to presenters, from Uncle Bob’s architecture talk and Avdi Grimm’s upcoming ‘Objects on Rails’ book to the proliferation of (competing? complementing?) database systems, it seems the time has come to seriously consider decoupling our objects’ persistence from the rest of the application.</p>
              <p>This talk – after describing the general vices of strong object/database coupling and the all-too-usual rails g model-driven development – covers the various approaches to separating the objects’ persistence layer, along with their virtues (cleaner, simpler tests! backend independence! no RDBMS-related shortcuts impacting the design!) and potential vices (performance? perceived compexity? YAGNI?).</p>

              <p>Responsive Web Design is all about having the same content visible in all devices, from tiny mobiles to huge monitors, preserving proper readability and adapting to the medium. It also entails a new way of creating content, in which interaction between designers and programmers is more important. In the Ruby world programmers generally feel proud of being "agile", however when you zoom out, you see that the interaction between designers and programmers is more waterfally than you'd want.</p>
              <p>In the talk I will present the concept of responsiveness and teach with examples how to make a layout responsive with the one-two punch of fluid layouts and media queries. I will also show how to make the interaction between designers and programmers be truly collaborative and not just a pass-me-down PSD from the designer to implementors and programmers.</p>

              <p>A lot has been said recently about the topic of Rails and OOP. We consider this issue very important in our community. This fight is all about the recent OOP movements in the Rails world. There are quite a few problems that people focus on and quite a few proposed solutions. </p>
              <p>We want to cover topics like: persistence and domain logic separation, DCI, backend/frontend separation, "Objects on Rails", TDD and unclebob's "Rails is not your app". Each of this approaches tries to solve the problem differently. </p>
              <p>We gathered a group of people that have some interesting opinions on this topic. We want to put them on stage and start the discussion. There will be questions prepared before the discussion, to ensure that we go through all of the important topics. Additionally, we’re planning to have questions from the audience.</p>

              <p>
                Open-Source is driven by innovation from the people. Controversial ideas often change the way software developers write software. It can be a tedious, awkward task to promote, develop and maintain such projects. But in the end of the day it feels just great, doesn't it?

              <h4><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYmHOF58bDY" target="_blank">Fear of adding processes</a></h4>
              <p>
                In object-oriented programming, there is a well-known anti-pattern called 'Fear of Adding Classes'. It describes the fear of solving a problem by adding another class because of the (often wrongfully) perceived added complexity. With systems moving towards a distributed nature through the usage of external services, a similar pattern can be seen: the fear of adding dedicated components, mostly independent processes to the system, because of the fear of added management overhead through doing so.

                After leaving the corporate universe and developing a few computer games (like <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/ps3/motorstorm">Motorstorm</a>
                and <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/saints-row-2">Saints Row 2</a>) for the PS3, XBOX and PC, he entered the Ruby World. Today, he is making delicious software at <a href="http://applicake.com">Applicake</a>, managing projects and training fellow programmers during <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/71470546@N08/sets/72157628278787087/with/6454903049">Code Retreats</a>. He enjoys pushing people out of their comfort zones and into new rewarding experiences. He can talk for hours about how seemingly unrelated skills (such as running, dancing or juggling) can help you become a better programmer.

              <h4><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXQLil_SGCI" target="_blank">Programming Workout</a></h4>
              <p>
                Times are changing... Technology is moving forward... Command line tools are becoming obsolete... Programmers today don't need to touch type... Using mouse to copy and paste is perfectly fine... You can always look up those design patterns on the web... Your IDE can do a lot of things for you so you don't need to think... Can you feel that? Can you feel that this is TRUE? Then stop being UNPROFESSIONAL and think again! 
              </p>
              <p>
                In this talk I'm gonna convince you that learning seemingly obsolete skills can have huge impact on your productivity. I'll show you how those skills and other seemingly unimportant factors can impact your career. I will help you to find a way to improve them in order to become a better programmer. I'll also show you tools that can facilitate this process. You will either leave this talk with strong resolution to level up, or curl up in your comfort zone with your lovely mouse and IDE. I will show you how PROGRAMMERS WORK OUT.

All three have known each other for years and have worked on a wide range of projects. Along the way, they’ve gained extensive experience on all levels of web application development and how to found and maintain profitable web businesses, without disregarding the challenge to have some serious fun along the way ;) They love all things cool and nerdy, but their fields of expertise are API design, Ruby, Rails, project management, and payment solutions. As developers and business founders they've had their fair share of falling into the pits of application development and would now like to share some of the insights they've gained from past mistakes.

                In our talk we share some of the most interesting, absurd, or funny insights and moments we experienced in our past couple of years. As developers and business founders, we present the best of our own mistakes and show you how we got out of the pits we fell into. Believe us, we’ve been there as well and, hopefully, attending our talk will help you not making the mistakes we already made for you ;) It will be serious fun! The talk will cover both technical and other subjects.

              <p>
                I would like to share our team experience in testing and tell the story of "how we get there" - successive stages of evolution (not writing tests at all, rspec, rspec story runner, cucumber). I will show you how we are doing it now (rspec + capybara + our custom dsl) and why we took more object oriented approach, taking user's perspective for writing integration and acceptance tests. I'll also tell you how we integrate all of this in form of documentation in applications we make.
